# SafeSpace

## Problem Statement
Creating a wristwatch based monitoring system along with an Android app to display and manage the data. The system will monitor important industrial metrics related to safety and air quality to ensure a safe working environment for maintenance technicians.

## Objectives
The project aims to develop a wristwatch-based monitoring system for confined space entry and maintenance jobs. 
The system will monitor safety metrics, such as O2 levels and flammable gases, and track key performance indicators (KPIs) related to response time, job completion, and wrench time.

#### Thresholds:
  Flammable gas, vapor, or mist in excess of 10 percent of its lower flammable limit (LFL);
  Airborne combustible dust at a concentration that meets or exceeds its LFL;
  Atmospheric oxygen concentration below 19.5 percent or above 23.5 percent;
